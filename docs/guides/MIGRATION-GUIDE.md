# Complete Migration Guide - From Bose Cloud to Local SoundTouch Service

## Overview

This guide will walk you through migrating your Bose SoundTouch speakers from Bose's cloud services to AfterTouch, your own local SoundTouch service. By the end of this process, your speakers will be completely independent of Bose's servers while retaining all their functionality.

> **💡 Why Migrate?** Bose announced the shutdown of their SoundTouch cloud services in May 2026. This migration ensures your speakers continue working indefinitely with enhanced local control and monitoring.

## What You'll Need

### Hardware Requirements
- **Raspberry Pi 4 or similar** (minimum: Raspberry Pi Zero 2W)
- **MicroSD card** (16GB or larger)
- **USB drive** (for device preparation)
- **Network connection** for your Raspberry Pi

### Before You Start
- **List all your SoundTouch devices** and their current locations
- **Note your current presets and favorites** (they will be preserved)
- **Ensure devices are on the same network** as your future SoundTouch service
- **Basic computer skills** (following instructions, using a web browser)

### Time Estimate
- **Setup**: 30-60 minutes for the service installation
- **Per Device**: 10-15 minutes for each speaker migration
- **Total**: 1-3 hours depending on number of devices

## Step 1: Install SoundTouch Service

### Option A: Raspberry Pi Installation (Recommended)

#### 1.1 Prepare Your Raspberry Pi

1. **Flash Raspberry Pi OS** to your SD card using Raspberry Pi Imager (see the raspberrypi.com documentation)
2. **Enable SSH** during imaging or create an empty `ssh` file on the boot partition
3. **Boot your Pi** and connect it to your network
4. **Find your Pi's IP address** (check your router or use `ping raspberrypi.local`)

#### 1.2 Install SoundTouch Service

Connect to your Pi via SSH and run:

```bash
# Download and install
curl -sSL https://github.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash

# Start the service
sudo systemctl enable soundtouch-service
sudo systemctl start soundtouch-service
```

#### 1.3 Verify Installation

1. Open your web browser
2. Go to `http://[PI_IP_ADDRESS]:8000` (replace with your Pi's IP)
3. You should see the **SoundTouch Service Dashboard**

![SoundTouch Service Dashboard](../images/dashboard-home.png)
*Example: SoundTouch Service main dashboard*

### Option B: Docker Installation

If you prefer Docker, run:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name soundtouch-service \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  -v soundtouch-data:/data \
  gesellix/soundtouch-service:latest
```

## Step 2: Create Your Account

### 2.1 Initial Setup

1. **Open the dashboard** at `http://[SERVICE_IP]:8000`
2. Click **"Create New Account"**
3. **Fill in your details**:
   - Account Name: `My Home Audio`
   - Email: `your@email.com` (optional, for notifications)
   - Migration Strategy: `Gradual` (recommended)

![Account Creation](../images/account-creation.png)
*Example: Account creation form*

### 2.2 Account Configuration

After creation, you'll see your **Account Dashboard**:
- **Account ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., `acc_home_audio_001`)
- **Status**: `Active - Ready for Migration`
- **Device Count**: Initially 0
- **Migration Status**: `Prepared`

![Account Dashboard](../images/account-dashboard.png)
*Example: Fresh account dashboard ready for device migration*

### 2.3 Initial Settings

Once your account is created, configure the global settings:
1. **Settings**:
   - Check **Target Domain**: Ensure it's reachable from the speaker (e.g., `soundtouch.fritz.box`).
   - **DNS Discovery**: Enable DNS discovery on port `:53`. This is crucial for the DNS hook migration method.
2. **Devices**:
   - Go to the **"Device Discovery"** tab.
   - Click **"Scan Network"** or manually add a speaker via IP address.
   - Your devices should appear with **SSH Status**: `Enabled`.

![Device Discovery](../images/device-discovery.png)
*Example: Discovered devices with remote access enabled*

## Step 3: Prepare Your Devices

> **⚠️ Important**: This step temporarily enables SSH access on your speakers. SSH will be automatically disabled after migration unless you choose to keep it enabled.

### 3.1 Enable Remote Services

For each SoundTouch device:

1. **Prepare a USB drive**:
   - Format as FAT32
   - Create an empty file named `remote_services` (no extension)
   - ~~(Optional) Firmware update/reset.~~ The official Bose SoundTouch USB update website is not available anymore.

2. **Insert USB drive** into your SoundTouch speaker
3. **Power cycle** the device (unplug for 10 seconds, then reconnect)

![USB Preparation](../images/usb-remote-services.png)
*Example: USB drive setup for enabling remote services*

## Step 4: Discover and Register Devices

### 4.1 Automatic Discovery

The service automatically scans for SoundTouch devices every 5 minutes. To trigger immediate discovery:

1. **Dashboard** → **"Devices"** → **"Discover Devices"**
2. **Wait 30-60 seconds** for scan completion
3. **Review discovered devices** in the list

### 4.2 Register Devices to Your Account

For each discovered device:

1. **Click device name** in the discovery list
2. **Verify device information**:
   - Name: `Living Room Speaker`
   - Model: `SoundTouch 30`
   - MAC Address: `A8:1B:6A:53:6A:98`
   - IP Address: `192.168.1.100`
   - Status: `Discovered - Ready for Registration`

3. **Click "Register to Account"**
4. **Choose registration type**:
   - **Fresh Setup**: For new or factory-reset devices
   - **Migrate from Bose**: For devices with existing Bose account (recommended)

![Device Registration](../images/device-registration.png)
*Example: Device registration dialog with migration options*

### 4.3 Device Registration Results

After registration, you'll see:
- **Device Status**: `Registered - Active`
- **Account Association**: Your account name
- **Lifecycle State**: `Active`
- **Data Sources**: `Mirror Primary` (initially uses Bose, falls back to local)

## Step 5: Migrate Individual Devices

### 5.1 Step 3: Data Sync

1. **Dashboard** → **"Devices"** → Select your device
2. Click **"Data Sync"**
3. This fetches configuration (presets, recents, sources) from the speaker to the SoundTouch service.

### 5.2 Step 4: Migration

Once data is synced, proceed to the migration tab for the device:

1. **Backup XML**: Create an off-device backup of the current configuration.
2. **Enable Persistent Remote Service**: This ensures SSH remains available after reboots.
   - *Note*: If you see `'rw: command not found'`, you can safely ignore it.
3. **CA Certificate Configuration**:
   - **Test with explicit CA**: Verify the speaker can communicate using the local CA.
   - **Trust CA now**: Inject the local Root CA into the speaker's trust store.
   - **Test with shared trust store**: Verify general HTTPS communication.
4. **Migration Method**:
   - Select **"Redirect via DNS hook"**.
   - **Test DNS Redirection**: Ensure the speaker correctly resolves the service domain.
5. **Confirm Migration**: Apply the final changes to the speaker.

#### Example Migration Output:
