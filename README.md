## Context: Cloud Shutdown

Bose is shutting down SoundTouch cloud services on **May 6, 2026**. After that, music service browsing, preset sync, and the official SoundTouch app stop working. This toolkit lets you keep your speakers fully functional.

See the [Survival Guide](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/guides/SURVIVAL-GUIDE.html) for the full picture.

## Tools

### soundtouch-service — AfterTouch

A local server that replaces the Bose cloud ("AfterTouch"). Once your speaker is redirected to it, you have full control without any Bose cloud dependency. The built-in web UI at `http://localhost:8000` handles all setup — no config files needed to get started.

If you want to run a server for this - no problem. The service is small enough to run on the SoundTouch itself. See the [On-Device Installer](./scripts/on-device-install/README.md) for instructions.

**Two scenarios:**

**Before shutdown — migrate your existing setup**
While the Bose cloud is still running, use `soundtouch-backup` to save your account data. The local service web UI then helps with the migration so your speaker keeps its presets and credentials.

**After shutdown or factory reset — start fresh**
Create a local account, configure your speakers, and start using them immediately. No Bose infrastructure required.

**Redirecting your speaker**

The service needs a stable address on your local network (e.g. `soundtouch.fritz.box` or `soundtouch.local`). The speaker must then be redirected to resolve the Bose cloud hostnames to that address. Two supported methods:

| Method       | How it works                        | Notes                                                        |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| XML redirect | Upload a config XML via the Web API | Surgical; covers only registered endpoints; best for testing |
| DNS/DHCP     | Serve custom DNS on your network    | Covers all devices at once; requires port 53 and TLS         |

The web UI walks you through each method. DNS redirect requires HTTPS — the service manages its own CA certificate and the web UI guides you through trusting it on each speaker.

> **Note:** A hosts-file method (direct SSH edits to `/etc/hosts`) also exists in the codebase but is deprecated and not exposed in the web UI.

**Enabling SSH via USB stick**

Some setup steps require SSH access to the speaker. Enable it once per device: create a file named `remote_services` on a FAT-formatted USB drive (the drive may need its bootable flag set — see [SoundCork issue #172](https://github.com/deborahgu/soundcork/issues/172)), and insert it while the speaker is powered on. After reboot, root SSH is available with no password.

See [Device Initial Setup](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/guides/DEVICE-INITIAL-SETUP.html) and [Migration Guide](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/guides/MIGRATION-GUIDE.html) for step-by-step instructions.

### soundtouch-backup

Backs up your Bose cloud account (presets, paired devices, music sources) and each speaker's local state before the shutdown. Run `soundtouch-backup all` to capture everything in one step; it authenticates with the Bose cloud, then polls each paired speaker over the local network.

See the [soundtouch-backup README](cmd/soundtouch-backup/README.md) for usage.

---

### soundtouch-cli

Command-line control of any SoundTouch device: play/pause/volume, presets, source selection, multiroom zones, device discovery, and more. Works entirely over the local network — no cloud dependency. Well-suited for scripting and home automation.

See the [CLI Reference](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/guides/CLI-REFERENCE.html) for full usage.

---

### soundtouch-web

A standalone web UI for device control — play, pause, volume, preset selection, real-time status — served from a local Go binary. Complements `soundtouch-service` when you want a dedicated device-control interface separate from the setup/admin UI.

See the [soundtouch-web README](cmd/soundtouch-web/README.md) for usage.

---

### Go library

`pkg/client` provides a Go API for all SoundTouch device endpoints: media control, volume, presets, sources, zones, real-time WebSocket events, and device discovery. Use it to build your own integrations.

```
go get github.com/gesellix/bose-soundtouch
```

See the [API Reference](https://gesellix.github.io/Bose-SoundTouch/reference/API-ENDPOINTS.html) and [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gesellix/bose-soundtouch) for documentation.
